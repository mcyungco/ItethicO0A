         - Legend of Gynes is a about a shepherd who was found a magic ring that can make you invisible and would make him go anywhere he want to go. He use the ring in bad way. He use the ring to enter the Royal Palace that he seduce the Queen and murder the King.  There were such two rings one is given to a man who as virtue and one given to a selfish one.

The question raise in the story is Why be moral?

 

       2.  Distinguish between psychological and ethical egoism.

       -The Difference between Psychological and Ethical egonism is Psychological egonism is the view that all men are selfish in everything that they do. And Ethical egonism is about how people ought to act regardless how man behave and they do something without an obligation except if they want to do in own interest.

          

       3. Rachels discusses two arguments for psychological egoism. What are these arguments, and how does he reply to them?

      -The first argument that Rachels talk about describing one’s person action as selfish and another person’s action as unselfish. He talks about in this argument is when will be the person is unselfish. He also tell that it is a untrue if people voluntarily do anything except what they want to do. Rachels also tell that the is two classes of action, One is they are actions which people don’t want to do but do it anyway to achieve something. The another action is people do not because they want to do but they feel obligate to something.

The second argument  is about unselfish action that always produce of self-satisfaction. This argument is about self-satifaction that can gives a clear conscience or He would have been ashamed of himself for not doing that.

 

 

         4. What three commonplace confusions does Rachels detect in the thesis of psychological egoism?

     - The First confusion Rachels detect in the thesis of psychological egoism is the confusion of selfishness with the self- interest.  In this confusion He said that the concept of this has  a definite evaluative flavor to call someone a “selfish” but it is not just to describe his action but to condemn it.

The Second confusion is the assumption that every action is done either from self-interest or from others regarding motives. This confusion explain that every action must be done from self interest.

The third confusion is false assumption that aa concern for one’s own welfare is incompatible with any genuine concern for the welfare of others.  It explain that everyone does desire his own well-being it might thought that no one can really be concerned with others but Rachel said that is false  because there is no inconsistency in desiring that everyone including oneself and others be well-off and happy.

 

         5. According to Rachels, why shouldn't we hurt others, and why should we help other? How can the egoist reply?

       - According to Rachels, We shouldn’t hurt each other because we will not happy if we hurt someone. We should help others because it would benefit others.

 

 

Discussion Questions

 

1. Has Rachels answered the question raised by Glaucon, namely "Why be moral?" If so, what exactly is his answer?

          - For me, Rachels didn't exactly answered the question raised by Glaucon because Rachels is confuse what view is correct.

 

2. Are genuine egoist rare, as Rachels claims? Is it a fact that most people care about Others? even people they don't know?

        - For me, It is not real that most people care about people that they know because I think people cares those people that has care for them and sometimes people are just obligate to care others for the sake that they help others.

 

3. Suppose we define ethical altruism as the view that one should always act for the benefit of others and never in one's own self-interest. In such a view immoral or not?

- Somehow it is immoral because if you always act for others to benefits and forgetting to care for yourself it is not good because if you can't care with yourself how can you care about others.
