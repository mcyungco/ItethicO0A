Review Questions:

 

      1. Rachels says that classical utilitarianism can be summed up in three propositions. What are they?

           - There three composition of Ulitarianism. First, Actions are to be judge right or wrong solely in virtue of the consequence. It only shows that if you have a wrong decision it might have a bad consequence and if you have a right action/decision it brings back to you a good consequence..

             -Second, Assesing consequence, the only thing that matter is the amount of happiness or unhappiness that is caused. It shows here that if you have a right decision it make/ produce the greatest happiness.

    - Third,is your happiness is more important than anyone else. 

 

     2.  Explain the problem with hedonism. How do defenders of utilitarianism respond to this problem?

          -The problem of Hedonism is that Hedonism misunderstand the concept of happines. Like hedosimn tells us happiness is something that is recognized as good and sought for its own sake, with other things appriciated only as bring about it. Instead happiness is a response we have to attain of the things would make us happy.
