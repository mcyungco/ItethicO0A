Discussion Questions

 

         1. Has Arthur refuted the divine command theory? If not, how can it be defended?

               - Yes, Arthur refuted the divine command theory because divine command theory tell us that if no God there will be no morals. For me, not just God that can make us moral because before God introduce to us I think there is morals. What if there is no God, it doesn't mean that there is chaos?.

 

2. If moral is social as Dewey says, then how can we have any obligation to nonhuman animals? (Arthur mentions this problem and some possible solution to it in footnote 6.)

            -  We are obligate to nonhuman animals because animals are like humans even they don't think to much or not talking they are still nature being and animals are just like us.

 

3. What does Dewey mean by moral education? Does a college ethics class count as moral education?

               - According to Dewey, morals should not only taught  but it is a must, It should have training, moral thinking depends on people's ability to imagine with others reaction and imagine what will happen if we are in the situation. For me, college ethics class is counted as moral education because it will help us to think what is really good or bad.
