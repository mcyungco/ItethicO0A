Review Questions :

 

 

1.     1.   Explain Kant’s account of the good will.

-          Kant’s account of good will is not possible to have anything in this world. This can be taken as  a good without any qualification  apart from a good will. It means that if good will happens the action can’t be good without qualification.

 

1.      2.  Distinguish between hypothetical and categorical imperatives.

-          Hypothetical imperatives is when we are clueless of what will happen until its condition is given. Whereas Categorical imperatives when he knows  what will happen once it was given.

 

1.       3. State the first formulation of the categorical imperative (using the notion of a universe law), and explain how Kant uses this rule to derive some specific duties toward self and others.

-          “Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it becomes a universal law.” Kant uses this rule to derive some specific duties toward self and others by categorizing duties; first is the perfect duties toward ourselves, perfect duties toward, imperfect duties toward ourselves and imperfect duties toward others. He also said that for the moral scheme to be true you must not give condition tied to it including the personality of the person and people around the person.


1.      4.  State the second version of the categorical imperative (using the language of means and end), and explain it.

-          The second version is about the imperfect duty. This version states the humanity deserve to be treated as Human persons it means that when you do something there will be always a outcome and it will justify that action.

 

Discussion Questions :

 

1.       1. Are the two versions of the categorical imperative just different expressions of one basic rule, or are they two different rules? Defend your view

-          For me the versions are similar and it is just a different expressions of one basic rule because it talks about loving yourself and treatment to others.

 

1.            2. Kant claims that an action that is not done from the motive of duty has no moral worth. Do you agree or not? If not, give some counter examples.

-          No, because not all duties are moral worth.

 

2.         3. Some commentators think that the categorical imperative (particularly the first formulation) can be used to justify non-moral or immoral actions. Is this good criticism?

-          I believe it is a good criticism because a categorical imperative can be used to justify non – moral or immoral action of a human person.
