Joel Feinberg-The Nature and Value of Rights


Review Questions:

 

1.      Describe Nowheresville. How is this world different from our world?

-        As I read the context, Nowhereville is a world that people do not have a rights. The people in this world cannot make moral claims when they are treated unjust. People cannot demand or claim just treatment they also deprived of self-respect and human diginity it means that even they are violated they cannot comment nor complain. The difference from our world is that we can complain and give justice whenever we are violated. We have the rights to speak and we have self-respect.

 

2.      Explain the doctrine of the logical correlativity of rights and duties. What is Feinberg’s position on this doctrine?

-        The doctrine of the logical correlativity of rights and duties is the doctrine that all duties entail other people’s rights and all rights entails other people’s duties. Feinberg said that all duties are correlated with the rights of those to whom the duty is owned.

 

3.      How does Feinberg explain the concept of personal desert? How would personal desert work in Nowheresville?

-        Personal desert is when a person is deserved something good from use what is meant in parts is that there would be certain proprietary in our giving that good thing to him in virtue of kind of person he is, perhaps, or more likely, in virtue of some specific thing he has done. It means that deserving something good is not the same as having a right to it.  Since Nowheresville have a no rights I think it would probably work if people are deserve to have something good if they done well the people cannot demand but they will happily accept it.

 

4.      Explain the notion of a sovereign right-monopoly. How would this work in Nowheresville according to Feinberg?

-        The notion of sovereign right – monopoly is about latter case that he could be said not merely to deserve the good thing but also have a right to it as his due.  According to Feinberg,  Nowheresville the weaker kind of proprietary which is mere dessert is basically kind of suitable  between ones party’s character or action and another party’s favourable response, much like that between humors, laughter, or good performance applause.

 

5.      What are claim-rights? Why does Feinberg think they are morally important?

       -  The right is type of claim and claim is a declaration of rights , Morally important because as humans everyone has a rights and people have a right to treat them with just and treat them good.

 

 

Discussion Questions:

1.      Does Feinberg make a convincing case for the importance of rights? Why or why not?

-        Yes, because in the imaginary world (Nowheresville) the people there is have no rights and it is importance to have right because if you feel violated you can claim your rights to be just.

2.      Can you give a noncircular definition of claim of right?

-        Claim right is to have a right given to a person to claim their justice or right to claim their self-respect.
